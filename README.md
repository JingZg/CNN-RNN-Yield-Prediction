## Getting Started 

Please install the following packages in Python3:

- numpy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib


## Dimension of Input Data

Let nw, ns, np, and nss be the number of weather components, soil components meaured at different depth, planting time component, and soil components meaured at the surface. Let m be the total number of observations. So `X` is `m-by-(nw+ns+np+nss)`. We added three columns to the begining of the matrix `X` which are location_id, year, and yield response variable.  If input data is not in this format, the code would not run.

- `number of weather components (nw)`: 6 components.
- `number of soil components measured at different depth (ns)`: 10 components.
- `number of planting date components (np)`: 16 (corn), 14 (soybean)
- `number of soil components measured at the surface (nss)`: 4

For detailed description of the variables, please read the data section of the paper.

## Success Strory of the Model in the Real World Application

We used the proposed method in practice in July 2019 for the prediction of the soybean yield of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana states. This year soybean yield after harvesting published by USDA about two weeks ago. The actual yields are very close to what we predicted in July, which are as follows:

|State|         Predicted Yield in July 2019          |Actual Yield|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|Iowa|                  53.44 (bu/ac)|                  53 (bu/ac)|
|Illinois|              48.71 (bu/ac)|                  51 (bu/ac)|
|Indiana|               47.01 (bu/ac)|                  49 (bu/ac)|
